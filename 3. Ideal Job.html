<b>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</b>
<p>A Penetration Tester is an IT security specialist that try to hack into networks to find potential vulnerabilities in the system, they've been called "Ethical hackers". My friend is a penetration tester and his stories are what got me interested in
I.T, the position is appealing to me because it takes skill and knowledge to hack and find the weak points.</p>
<br>
<b>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</b>
<p>Need a high level of skill and qualifications such as advanced computer skills and an understanding of networking, to be able to program and have scripting skills with knowledge of programming languages and operating systems, 
problem solving to be able to handle any issues that might arise, they also need to keep up to date on security software and learn new protocols and technologies to be able to find exploits in the systems. Many employers look for penetration testers that have a bachelor's degree in I.T, computer science 
or information security and have a few years of experience.</p>
<br>
<b>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</b>
<p>I currently don't have any of the skills or experience required for the job, I've learnt the basics of HTML, GitHub and I'm trying to learn how to write reports.</p>
<br>
<b>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.</b>
<p>My plan is to study hard to learn how to be a penetration tester by going into a Security course and a Networking course. To also learn the different code languages, how to code better, try and get better at writing reports, learn the different operating systems and my friend who is an actual Penetration tester is going to give me some tips and some resources.</p>
