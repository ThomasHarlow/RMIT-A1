<h1> Assignment 1 - Interest in I.T</h1>

<b> Thomas Harlow - s3875137</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</b>
<p>I've been interested in I.T before I even knew what it was, I was around 5 when my dad bought the Nintendo and I played that all the time, then it grew to PC gaming
as I got older, then I met a friend 7 years ago who was doing an IT University course while we were both playing an online video game and he got me interested in doing I.T, hearing about his job after he graduated had me interested, 
and with the state of the world and the current job market I felt it was the right time to increase my knowledge of I.T which can help me in the long run.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b>
<p>The choice of RMIT was due to many factors, including but not limited to the current social climate and the many struggles Australians are facing,
 including drastic changes to how we operate on a day to day basis. RMIT has lead the way for online learning and teaching support through correspondence, 
so my choice to enrol here was a logical one, and came naturally as my first preference.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b>
<p>I'm here to learn different aspects and skills related to I.T, from learning how to network and code to get into my chosen field, how to better use HTML tags to make better websites, to be able to understand and use Github, 
to working with my group on projects and create and do presentations.</p>
