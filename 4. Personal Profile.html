<br>
<br>
<b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b>
<p>The test results shows me that i am kinda in the middle when it comes to most things, that i should be able to work with a lot of people pretty effectively while not being too over the top to annoy my team. </p>
<br>
<b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b>
<p>I'm fairly in the middle but if i was fully one way i'd try and change myself as to not be overbearing for my team.</p>
<br>
<b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b>
<p>If i was forming a team, i'd try and find people who can i can work effectively with, and that i'd try and form a well rounded team that can compensate for my weaknesses.</p>

<br>
<br>
<b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b>
<p>I'm not sure, i've always been more of a visual learner, but i do like learning the theory behind what i am working or learning and finding background imformation.</p>
<br>
<b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b>
<p>It'll help me deep dive into theoritical problems of the project allowing others to focus  practical side of troubleshooting, and see if i am suited as a theorist, at this stage i wouldn't like to pigeon hole myself, i'd like to spend time exploring the practical course and build up an even skill set</p>
<br>
<b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b>
<p>Form a team with different learning styles to balance out the team.</p>
<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b>
<p>I wasn't sure so i read "Seven Simple Strategies for Frontline Leaders" to get a clearer understanding of what a Front-line leader really is and should do, so the test helped me learn more about my leadership style and means i can hopefully help my team </p>
<br>
<b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b>
<p>I dont't think the results will influence my behaviour that much, I'll keep doing what i do with my team, be there for them and hear them out with any problems they have with work or real life and help if i can, and just be seen working to inspire them and show that i am also helping. </p>
<br>
<b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b>
<p>I'd form a team that i could work well with and get along, if not then work to get to know them so we can work as a team more effectively. </p>
